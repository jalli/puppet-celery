celery for puppet
=================
This installs and configures `Celery`_.

This is a `puppet`_ module for using Python's `pip`_.  Puppet has a
built-in pip provider, but it's implementation leaves out a few pieces:

* No ability to install from requirements file.
* No ability to add extra arguments
* No support for using mirrors or specifying alternate indexes.

This module fixes this.


Usage
-----
Make sure this module is available by adding this repository's contents
in a directory called ``celery`` inside your Puppet's ``moduledir``.
It also requires the `puppet-pip`_ module as well.


Bootstrapping RabbitMQ
""""""""""""""""""""""
If you need to bootstrap RabbitMQ (note that this requires that you have
`this version`_ of `puppetlabs-rabbitmq`_ to run on RabbitMQ 2.6)::

    class { "celery::rabbitmq": }

You should provide a ``user``, ``vhost``, and ``password`` along these
lines::

    class { "celery::rabbitmq":
      $user => "myuser",
      $vhost => "myvhost",
      $password => "secret",
    }

This installs and configures RabbitMQ.  Take a look at
`puppetlabs-rabbitmq`_ if you need more flexibility in how your RabbitMQ
instance is initialized.

Creating Celery Server
""""""""""""""""""""""
You create a celery server with the ``celery::server`` class like this::

    class { "celery::server": }

If you're relying on the RabbitMQ bootstrap, you would set it up like this::

    class { "celery::server":
      require => Class["celery::rabbitmq"],
    }
